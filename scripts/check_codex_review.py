"""Gate a pull request on the Codex review having run and been answered.

Codex in GitHub reports neither a check run nor a commit status, so there is
nothing to mark required in branch protection. It leaves two signals instead:

- If it has findings, GitHub records the reviewed commit in the review's
  structured ``commit_id`` and Codex posts one inline thread per finding.
  Older Codex review bodies also carried ``**Reviewed commit:** `<sha>` ``;
  that text remains a compatibility fallback.
- If it is clean, it posts nothing at all and reacts :+1:.

This script reads both and decides whether the pull request satisfies the
review protocol in CONTRIBUTING.md: Codex has looked at the current head, and
no finding is left unanswered. Threads are the unit of "answered" because that
is what the protocol already tracks -- fixed, filed as an issue, or rejected
with evidence, then resolved.

The clean signal carries no commit sha, so freshness for that path is decided
on time: the reaction must be newer than the head commit. That commit date is
written by the committing client, not by GitHub, so anyone able to push can
defeat this rung by backdating -- with `GIT_COMMITTER_DATE`, or by force-pushing
older history. An earlier version of this docstring claimed pushing new work
could not keep a stale :+1: valid. It can, and #224 tracks moving the
comparison onto the server-assigned push time in the pull request timeline.
The reviewed-a-named-sha path is unaffected.

There is a third thing Codex does: when the account is out of review credits
it answers with an ordinary comment and reads nothing. That stays a failure --
the diff really was not reviewed -- but it is reported as itself, because the
usual "comment `@codex review`" advice cannot succeed in that state.

Stdlib only, so the workflow runs it without installing the project.
